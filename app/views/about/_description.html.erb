<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">If you are newly embarking on a career in teaching English, you will first need some kind of teaching qualification in order to apply to jobs. Although a teaching qualification is not required 100% of the time, it is highly recommended for obtaining a better and higher paying teaching job. There are several teaching qualifications that you can pursue including the TESOL Certificate, the TEFL/TESL Certificates or the CELTA Certificate. You can study for your qualification both in class and online, depending on your preference and availability. Many of our partners offer these courses to prepare you for your teaching career.</p>
